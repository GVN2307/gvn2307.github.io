# My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio repository. This is a website I built to showcase my work in cybersecurity and penetration testing. I used Python Flask for the backend because it is secure and easy to work with.

## About the project
The design is inspired by hacker terminals and cyberpunk themes. I added a matrix rain effect in the background that looks really cool, especially with the neon green colors. The site is fully responsive, so it works great on phones and laptops.

I focused a lot on security features for this site.
- It has protection against spam and DDoS attacks using rate limiting.
- The contact form sanitizes all inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- It uses secure headers to keep the browsing session safe.

## How to run it on your computer
If you want to test this out, you can clone the repo and run it.

1. First, install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Then start the server:
   python app.py

It will run at localhost on port 5000.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Feel free to look around the code.
